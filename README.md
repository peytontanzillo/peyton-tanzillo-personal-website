# Peyton Tanzillo Personal Website

A personal project of mine to develop a custom portfolio website for myself to use for applying for jobs!

EDIT: Website is currently live at: peytontanzillo.com

Works best on desktop with Chrome currently, working towards adding mobile support and fixing all minor bugs on Firefox/Safari. I have yet to test the website on Edge (lol) or Opera, so I'm sure that's in my future somewhere.
